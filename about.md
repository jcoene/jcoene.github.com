## Hi, I'm Jason ;-)

I build applications out of my home in Rochester, NY. I like startups, delicious food and things that are well made. Get in touch, maybe I can help you turn your idea into reality. I measure before cutting, test continuously, keep things short and simple and avoid regression like the plague.

## Tools I Use

I develop in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), often with [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). I present with [HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/). Data lives in [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) or [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/). I practice [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development), and [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller). I use [Apple](http://apple.com) computers. Here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jcoene/dotfiles).

## My Contributions

I maintain these open source projects:

- [Operable](https://github.com/jcoene/operable) - Arithmetic operations for your Ruby models.
- [Mongoid Searchable](https://github.com/jcoene/mongoid-searchable) - Simple keyword search for Mongoid.
- [Mongoid Map/Reduce](https://github.com/jcoene/mongoid-mapreduce) - Formula based map-reduce for Mongoid.
